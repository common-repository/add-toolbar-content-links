= What's the point? =

I found myself constantly clicking to the wordpress dashboard in order to access the links to the pages I needed. This plugin save me clicks and thus saves me time.


== Screenshots ==

1. Showing immediately after the plugin is activated. There is now a toolbar link with dropdown to all the content type content. Note the 'Field Group' CPT.
2. Showing many more cutom post types that are supported. The top level link still links to edit the current page/content you are viewing.
3. The top level link shown to edit the Custom Post Type of 'Testimonial'.
